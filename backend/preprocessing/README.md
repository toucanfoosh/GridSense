### This folder/python file DOES NOT directly set the data up for training a model, but it is ready for you to do so if you wish.

## Overview
This folder contains the data preprocessing pipeline for GridSense's energy analysis system. The pipeline:

2. Cleans and normalizes datasets
3. Merges temporal data streams
4. Generates analysis visualizations
